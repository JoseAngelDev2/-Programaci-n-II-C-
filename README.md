## Improved Project Structure

To enhance the manageability and scalability of the project, we have restructured the directory layout:

- **src/**: Contains all the source code files
- **docs/**: Contains the documentation files
- **tests/**: Contains all the testing files
- **assets/**: Contains any supplementary files such as images and stylesheets

This structure follows best practices, making it easier for collaborators to navigate and contribute effectively to the project.
